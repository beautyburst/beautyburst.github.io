      <h2>TL;DR</h2>
      <p>An attacker can identify which streaming video a targeted user is
        watching on services such as Netflix and Youtube. The attack can be done
        remotely over the Internet, and requires only that the user (or even
        someone else on the same local network) visits a suitably-crafted
        website from their web browser.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and so, to garner what we behold is
      to glean what we cherish. Today, much of what we behold is video content
      streamed from the Internet, and our choice of movies, TV shows, news clips
      and social media videos reveals much about our personality, preferences,
      socioeconomics, and mood. A bevy of parties seek to exploit this
      information: whether for monetization by advertisers, insurers, and
      price-differentiating vendors, or to castigate those who access undesired
      information.
      <p> </p>
      <p> Encryption of Internet traffic places a hurdle to such monitoring, but
        it is known that traffic analysis, inspecting merely the size&nbsp; and
        timing of network traffic, often allows deduction about the traffic's
        content. How effective is traffic analysis for encrypted streamed
        videos, and how feasible is it for potential adversaries?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>We demonstrate highly effective techniques for how a <span  style="text-decoration: underline;">an
          attacker can deduce what of videos are watched by a targeted user on
          streaming services such as Netflix and Youtube</span>, from direct and
        indirect measurement of encrypted network traffic. We consider three
        classes of attack scenarios:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong> On-path attacks</strong>, the easiest scenario, involve an
        adversary who can passively monitor the user's traffic. This includes
        Internet Service Providers, malicious Wi-Fi access points, proxies,
        VPNs, routers, and taps on network connections. These have full and
        accurate visibility of individual packets, and using our techniques,
        they can <span  style="text-decoration: underline;">identify which </span><span
           style="text-decoration: underline;">encrypted videos are watched by
          users of the network links they monitor</span>.</p>

             alt="On-path attack"  src="img/onpath_attacker_figure.png">
          <div  class="caption">On-path video identification attack</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Cross-site attacks</strong>, where the only access the attacker
        has is the ability to send JavaScript code for execution by the victim's
        browser (see first figure below). This is a particularly dangerous
        scenario: untrusted JavaScript code from operators who have commercial
        interest in user viewing habits is, nowadays, ubiquitous. Browsers
        supposedly execute such JavaScript code in a confined standbox, to
        prevent it from gleaning private information. We show that this
        confinement fails: the attacker can measure the network traffic
        associated with video streaming, using a side channel: he floods the
        network link with his own data and measures the resulting fluctuations
        in the network congestion. <span  style="text-decoration: underline;">After
          a few minutes of such measurement, the video can be deduced</span>.</p>
      <div  class="figure">
        <div  style="width: 600px;"  class="image"> <img  style="padding-top: 0.5em; width: 95%;"
             alt="Cross-site attack"  src="img/remote_attacker_figure.png">
          <div  class="caption">Cross-site video identification attack </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Cross-device attacks</strong> are an even stronger way to
        identify the traffic patterns: for example, <span  style="text-decoration: underline;">a
          user watching Netflix on his TV may be attacked by JavaScript code
          which happens to run in a browser on some PC in the same local network</span>
        (see second figure below). This attack, too, relies on inducing and
        measuring congestion on the network link that is common to the streaming
        device and the neighboring PC.</p>
      <div  class="figure">
        <div  style="width: 600px;"  class="image"> <img  style="padding-top: 0.5em; width: 95%;"
             alt="Cross-device attack"  src="img/cross_device_tv_attacker_figure.png">
          <div  class="caption">Cross-site video identification attack </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p> To identify videos based on the recorded traffic patterns, we employ
        "deep learning" techniques using artificial neural networks, trained
        them on movies from several leading streaming services. The training of
        the neural-network video classifier needs to be done on videos streamed
        to a streaming device (or software) similar to the target user, and
        connected to a similar streaming server. When trained to recognize
        dozens of titles, our YouTube detector has <span  style="text-decoration: underline;">0
          false positives with 0.988 recall</span>, while the Netflix detector
        has a false positive rate of <span  style="text-decoration: underline;">
          0.0005 with 0.93 recall</span>.</p>
      <br>
      <hr><span  style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
      <h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
      <h3> Q1: What services are vulnerable?</h3>
      <p> We tested our detectors on four services: Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Video,
        and Vimeo. We found all of them to be vulnerable to our
        video-identification techniques.<br><br> Generally, any streaming service using
        the popular MPEG-DASH standard for streaming over HTTP(S), and specifically the MPEG-DASH content segmentation, is likely to cause an exploitable
        information leak. The inherent reason is discussed in <a  href="file:///home/eran/videos_traffic_analysis.git/web/beautyburst/index.html#q:why-leaks">Q6</a>
        below. All four services we tested are therefore vulnerable: YouTube directly follows the standard, while Amazon Video, Netflix, and Vimeo use very close variants which adopt its leaky use of content segmentation.
	</p>
      <h3> Q2: How could it be exploited?</h3>
      <p> Malicious Wi-Fi access points, proxies, routers, enterprise or
        national network moderators, and ISPs are all able to gain insight on
        user viewing habits by analyzing encrypted application layer traffic
        frames.</p>
      <p>Censhorship gateways can use this information to block monitored
        content even under encryption.</p>
      <p>All providers of web content accessed by the user, including
        advertisers, analytics providers and social networks, can also
        compromise the user's viewing privacy, by leveraging our side-channel
        attack.</p>
      <h3> Q3: How is VBR related to video content?</h3>
      <p>Compression using variable-bitrate (VBR) encoding is designed to use
        the minimum amount of data needed to represent a scene at a given
        perceptual quality. This highly dependent on the video content. For
        example, highly eventful action-scenes, such as the one in the video <a
           href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv9hn4IGofM">Iguana vs. Snakes</a>,
        require a high bitrate to represent. This is easily seen in the diagram
        below, depicting the bit rate fluctuations as the video progresses
        through different scenes.</p>
      <div  class="figure">
        <div  class="image subfigure"  style="width: 50%;"> <img  style="width: 95%; padding-top: 0.5em;"
             alt="Iguana vs. Snakes VBR"  src="img/iguana_orig_bitrate.png">
          <div  class="caption">Sizes of packets</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3> Q4: What are bursts in traffic pattern, and how are they related to
        video content?</h3>
      <p>In MPEG-DASH streaming, videos on the server are divided into segments
        that the video-player client then fetches. This results in an on/off,
        bursty traffic pattern during video streaming.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate how this relates to actual <b>content</b>, we used the aforementioned Iguana video: a high-bitrate portion of the video interleaved with a low-bitrate one.
	The left-hand figure shows packet sizes along
        the time axis; observe the pattern of buffering followed by the on/off
        steady state. The right-hand figure shows the size of traffic bursts;
        the first, largest burst is the buffer.</p>

          <div  class="caption">Sizes of packet bursts</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3> Q5: How does the video identification work?</h3>
      <p>The problem of automatically matching a burst series to a video title
        can be addressed by various machine learning algorithms. For example, it
        is natural to represent a streaming session as a series of burst sizes,
        and directly search for correlations with the bursts in other sessions
        to check if the same content was streamed. However, we require an
        approach that is very robust to the presence of noise and distortion
        that are introduced by encrypted protocol layers, by the indirect
        measurement using side channels attack channel (such as in our
        JavaScript-based attack), or by the streaming service as a mitigation. </p>
      Deep neural networks (artificial neural networks with multiple layers)
      have been recently proven highly effective in many pattern detection
      problems. Their design principles allow them to learn and utilize what is
      regarded as abstractions: concepts that are intuitive and easy to agree on
      for humans, yet hard to formally express. As a result, deep learning
      algorithms are basis for drastic improvements in many problems in vision,
      image processing, speech recognition, natural language processing, and
      others. We constructed a deep convolutional network architecture that
      detects videos using features from their traffic. Employing deep learning
      resulted in an accurate and noise-adaptive detector, effective even when
      measurements are performed from a side-channel.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <h3><a  name="q:why-leaks"></a> Q6: Why does this information leak happen?
        Can I make it stop?</h3>
      <p> The root cause of information leaks in video streams is that the
        amount of information needed to represent a video segment, at a given
        perceived quality, depends on the content of the segment. For example, a
        nearly-still nature scene, or a talk show where most of the picture is
        static, can be compressed to a much smaller size than a fast-paced
        action scene. Streaming services use Variable Bitrate (VBR) compression
        schemes that take advantage of this, to reduce the amount of transmitted
        data. Consequentially, their traffic pattern is data-dependent.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> One can eliminate VBR encoding, or slow down the adaptive response to
        change in video compressibility, but this reduces the compression ratio
        (hence, raises costs and may cause network congestion and&nbsp;
        buffering delays in video playback). </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> The VBR pattern is inherently observable in traffic if the duration of
        the client's buffered video is close to constant (or, more generally, an
        affine function of presentation time). Thus, one can try to foil
        analysis by erratically changing the buffer size, though this too
        reduces network efficiency and increases chance of buffering delay in
        video playback. </p>
      <h3> Q7: Can the attack be detected?</h3>
      <p>
	<p>The on-path attack is completely passive; it cannot be detectable, neither by the user nor by network-based monitors.</p>
	<p>
	The off-path attacks, in our experiments, were imperceptible to the viewer being targeted: the streaming playback proceeded without interruption despite the extra traffic induced by the attack.
	This is because the upstream routers try to fairly allocate the bandwidth among the multiple data streams: in our case, the video and attacker's.
	Since video streaming typically requires less than half of the available bandwidth, it can still be streamed at the requisite average pace. Moreover, whenever a video segment is transmitted, the routers typically give it a higher dynamic priority (i.e., a "fast pass" to the top of the queue), compared than the attacker's stream which has already used up more than its fair share.
	The extra traffic induced by the attacker will affect the user's total bandwidth usage, similarly to downloading a large file.
